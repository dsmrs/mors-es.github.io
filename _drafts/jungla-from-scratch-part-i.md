> This series of posts is an experimentation. I don't know _How to build a startup_. It's more a learning process, a documentation of all the steps we'll have to pass to test an idea.

## History of the project Jungla

The idea of Jungla was born in the heads of **David Alejandro Quiceno** and [**Caroline Tribut**](https://twitter.com/carolinetribut). I crossed their roads during the second quarter of 2017 in Medellin, Colombia. They wanted to help the tourists/expats/locals to find the best places in Medellin.

## Why I joined the team?

First David and Caroline are super sweet but more important for a long-term project, their competencies are diverse: graphical design and development. I also wanted to get new skills and learning how to develop a mobile app (the idea is mobile-centered).

## Viability

At first, they didn't think about how to monetize their idea. They were more focus on the gamification and the functionalities of the product. For me, every single idea has to be validated by the market first before developing any single line of code. But because I wanted to learn how to make a mobile app, I was ready to take the risk. So we bypassed the first interviews and market survey to get through directly the first prototype.

## Market validation

We all agreed on building a first mobile app with a hybrid method (for Android and iOS) with only one value proposition to test: a list of the best spots of Medellin. David was busy on [another project](http://www.vbot.com.co/) so we've decided to test the first product with Carline and me. She is in charge of the design of the screens and builds the list of the best places of Medellin while I was developing the app.

## Next steps

[Make de scenarios](/2018/) for the app.
