This is a tutorial for very beginners in web development. Just to show that it's easy to setup a first website and put it on the internet.


## Setup Github

In this tutorial we'll use [Github](htt://www.github.com) as a free hosting service (nice no ? :) ). For that you'll have to create an account. If you're many on the project, I advice you to create an organization with the name of your project (follow the steps [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch/))
Verify your email!

## Find a nice boostrap template

Because we're lazy or we don't know how to code, we'll download a free boostrap template. You can find some nice exemple in  [StartBootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/landing-pages/). Once you have find one you love, click on **View Source on Github**. For this tuto, I choose the template *creative*. You'll arrive on the *repository* where you can see all the files of the website.

## Fork and rename

On the repository you click on the **fork** button (like bellow) on the right-top of the page. You can choose to put this *fork*(= copy) on your profile or on your organization, it's up to you.

<iframe src="https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=BlackrockDigital&repo=startbootstrap-stylish-portfolio&type=fork&count=true&size=large" frameborder="0" scrolling="0" width="158px" height="30px"></iframe>

You're on track! Go to __www.your-(username/organization).github.io/startbootstrap-stylish-portfolio__ and you'll see the page.

We'll rename the repository, for that go to the tab **Settings**. There you can see the actual repository name. If you want the url look like _www.your-(username/organization).github.io_ instead of _www.your-(username/organization).github.io/name-of-the-repository_, change the name of the repository like this: `owner-tile.github.io`. `owner-tile` is your username or the name of your organization.

> It's really important to follow this naming convention! Github look after the repository with the name of the owner (you or your organization) + `.github.io`. Github will only serve this repository online.

## Modify content

[HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) it's a markup language. There are no logic in it, just *tags* who define the purpose of a content. Like `<p></p>` are the **start tag** and **end tag** for a paragraph or `<h1></h1>` are the tags for headings (=titles). Because we've choosed a really simple webpage. All the informations are in the `index.html`.
